# Tollplaza-Database-using-SQL
A toll plaza database management project aims to design and develop a comprehensive system to manage and maintain the data related to toll plazas. The project involves creating a database that can efficiently store, retrieve, and analyze data related to toll plaza operations.

Project Objectives:

Design a database schema to store toll plaza data, including toll rates, vehicle categories, and payment methods. Develop a user-friendly interface for toll plaza operators to manage and update data in real-time. Implement data analytics and reporting tools to provide insights on toll plaza operations, revenue, and traffic patterns. Ensure data security and integrity by implementing access controls, backups, and disaster recovery mechanisms. Functional Requirements:

Toll Rate Management: The system should allow administrators to create, update, and delete toll rates for different vehicle categories and payment methods. Vehicle Category Management: The system should enable administrators to manage vehicle categories, including adding, updating, and deleting categories. Payment Method Management: The system should allow administrators to manage payment methods, including cash, credit cards, and electronic toll collection systems. Transaction Management: The system should record and manage toll transactions, including payment details and vehicle information. Reporting and Analytics: The system should provide real-time reports and analytics on toll plaza operations, revenue, and traffic patterns. Non-Functional Requirements:

Security: The system should ensure data security and integrity by implementing access controls, encryption, and secure data storage. Scalability: The system should be designed to handle high volumes of transactions and data, with the ability to scale up or down as needed. Usability: The system should provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for toll plaza operators and administrators. Technical Requirements:

Database Management System: The system should use a relational database management system, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL. Programming Language: The system should be developed using a programming language, such as Java or Python. Web Framework: The system should use a web framework, such as Spring or Django, to develop the user interface and API. Project Deliverables:
